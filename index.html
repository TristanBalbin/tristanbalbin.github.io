Minecraft is a sandbox construction game designed by Markus "Notch" Persson and Mojang and developed on the Java platform. The game allows players to collect, assemble or destroy a variety of blocks in a three-dimensional, procedurally-generated environment. The game takes inspiration from multiple sources, specifically the game Infiniminer.

Development began in May 2009, with pre-orders for the full game starting June 13, 2009. The game was officially released by Notch in mid-November 2011 during MineCon.

Minecraft is the most sold game of all time.

Blocks
Main article: Blocks Blocks make up the Minecraft landscape and are integral to gameplay. They can be broken, collected, and placed in an infinite number of arrangements. They can be used in crafting and manipulated in many other ways. The face of a block is 16 by 16 pixels, and each block is proportionately one cubic meter.
Crafting
Main article: Crafting Since the uses of natural blocks are limited, it is imperative that players make use of the crafting interface to survive. Players can combine items in a 2×2 interface (extended to 3×3 by use of a Crafting Table), with each item taking up one square of the grid. Different arrangements of items create usable Items, which players can exploit to further their collection of resources, and in turn create more items.(pleas visit)
